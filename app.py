    ### ‚ùì **ASK** ‚Äî The Business Question
    This section sets the stage by defining the core business problem.

    **Business Task**: As a bank, we want to predict which loan applicants are at high risk of **defaulting** (failing to repay their loan). By identifying "good" versus "bad" clients, we can improve our loan approval process, manage risk more effectively and proactively offer support to prevent defaults.

    **Stakeholders**: The primary users of this analysis are **Bank Managers**, **Risk Analysts**, and **Customer Service** teams. They need a clear, actionable way to understand who is most likely to default and why.

    **Deliverables**: The final product is this interactive dashboard, which provides a comprehensive view of our analysis, from data preparation to model performance and final recommendations.

    ### üöÄ **ACT** ‚Äî Recommendations and Next Steps
    This is the most important section, as it translates data insights into a business strategy.

    - **Prioritize with Data**: The models identified key risk indicators like a client's `min_balance_before_loan` and `times_balance_below_5K`. These are powerful predictors of future default. Bank managers should use these insights to create more robust risk assessment rules. For example, any applicant whose balance drops below a certain threshold multiple times might require a more careful review.

    - **Proactive Retention**: Instead of waiting for clients to default, the bank can use the deployed model to get a daily list of accounts at high risk. A customer service representative can then proactively reach out to these clients to offer financial counseling, a small emergency loan, or a flexible payment plan, thereby reducing the risk of a loss.

    - **Deploy the Best Model**: The **Gradient Boosting** model is our top recommendation for deployment due to its superior performance on all metrics. This model will be the brain behind our new, proactive loan-risk strategy, helping the bank make smarter, data-driven decisions.
